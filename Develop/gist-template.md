# Mastering Email Regular Expressions: A Comprehensive Guide

Welcome to the Mastering Email Regular Expressions tutorial! In this guide, we'll delve into the world of regex and explore its various components, all with the goal of mastering the art of crafting and using regular expressions to effectively match and validate email addresses.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we'll focus on understanding and using the following regex pattern that matches email addresses:

regex
^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are regex elements used to match specific positions within the text. Here are two commonly used anchors:

^ (Caret): Matches the start of a line.
$ (Dollar Sign): Matches the end of a line

^Start 
End$

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers control the number of times a preceding element should occur. Here are a few examples:

*: Matches zero or more occurrences.
+: Matches one or more occurrences.
?: Matches zero or one occurrence.

code:

\d+
[a-z]*

### Character Classes

Character classes let you match specific sets of characters. examples:

[aeiou]: Matches any vowel.
[0-9]: Matches any digit.
\d: Matches any digit (shortcut).

[aeiou]
[0-9]

### Grouping and Capturing

Parentheses () are used for grouping and capturing parts of a pattern. They allow applying quantifiers to a group. Captured groups can be referenced later.

(a|b)+
(\d{2,4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2,4})


### Back-references

Back-references allow referring to previously captured groups. They're useful when searching for repeated patterns.
