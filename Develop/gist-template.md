# Mastering Regular Expressions: A Comprehensive Guide

Welcome to the Mastering Regular Expressions tutorial! In this guide, we'll dive into the world of regex and explore its various components, helping you become proficient in using regular expressions for pattern matching and manipulation of text.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we'll focus on understanding and using the following regex pattern that matches email addresses:

regex
^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are regex elements that match specific positions within the text. The ^ anchor matches the start of a line, while the $ anchor matches the end of a line. Anchors are useful for ensuring that a pattern occurs at a specific position within the text.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers control the number of times a preceding element or group should occur. For example, * matches zero or more occurrences, + matches one or more occurrences, and ? matches zero or one occurrence. These quantifiers help define the repetition of patterns.

### OR Operator

The OR operator | allows you to match either of two alternatives. For instance, (cat|dog) will match either "cat" or "dog". This is useful when you're looking for multiple possible patterns.

### Character Classes

Character classes let you match specific sets of characters. For example, [aeiou] will match any vowel. You can also use ranges like [0-9] to match digits. Predefined character classes like \d (digit), \w (word character), and \s (whitespace) are also available.

### Flags

Flags modify how regex patterns are matched. Common flags include i for case-insensitive matching, g for global matching, and m for multiline matching. Flags allow you to customize the behavior of your regex patterns.

### Grouping and Capturing

Parentheses () are used for grouping and capturing parts of a pattern. This allows you to apply quantifiers and modifiers to a group of characters. Captured groups can be referenced later in the regex or replacement text.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions define a set of characters enclosed within square brackets. They allow you to match any one character from the defined set. For example, [aeiou] matches any vowel.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

By default, quantifiers are greedy, meaning they match as much text as possible. Adding a ? after a quantifier makes it lazy, causing it to match as little text as possible. This is useful when you want to match the shortest possible string.

### Boundaries

Boundary assertions like \b match positions where a word starts or ends. They are useful for ensuring that a pattern occurs at word boundaries and doesn't match within larger words.

### Back-references

Back-references allow you to refer to previously captured groups within the regex pattern. For instance, (a)\1 will match "aa". Back-references are valuable when searching for repeated patterns.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Look-ahead (?=...) and look-behind (?<=...) assertions let you assert that a pattern is or isn't followed by or preceded by another pattern, respectively. They don't consume characters, making them useful for complex conditions.
